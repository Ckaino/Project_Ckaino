# Overview
Data-Driven Aircraft Risk Analysis for Safe Fleet Acquisition

# Business Understanding
To identify which aircraft make and model have the lowest historical accident rates, fewer fatal incidents, and lower safety risks

# Stakeholder and key business questions
which aircraft models and routes have high safety and security

# Data Understanding and Analysis
23,000+ incident reports (1962-2023) from Aviation _Data.csv file 
Data Cleanup:
Excluded models with incomplete records and filled the ones that had less missing values 
Changed Data Types with the preferred ones 
Correcting data inconsistence
Focused on:
1.Make and Model Overview
Identified which aircraft have the most fewest incidents
2.Injury & Damage Analysis
Analyze injury severity and aircraft damage for the safest models identified in make and model overview
3.Safer Aircraft identification
Used Total incidents, Counts all reported incidents per aircraft model
Fatal incidents total
Safety score(60%incidents 40%fatalities 

# Source of data
23,000+ incident reports (1962-2023) from Aviation _Data.csv file 

# Description of data
Data was from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

# Three visualizations (the same visualizations presented in the slides and notebook)
Average Risk Score Trend Over Time
Aircraft Model by Injuries
Key Finding In Make and Model Overview

# Conclusion
The business can invest in Cessna180 and 152 models
Risk scores decreased over time from 1996 to 2022
The models with least fatalities are 172,150m and 180
